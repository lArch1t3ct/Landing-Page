# Lessons Learnt
1. I experience the impostor syndrome during the project but I tackled it with the "I am still learning" mentality and "I'll make it work" attitude avoiding the use of any AI tool. At this stage will give me a false sense of knowledge and power over my code.
2. When I messed my CSS rules, I deleted all of them and started from the beginning instead of trying to correct the existing ones. The same holds true about the HTML code.
3. The dopamine seeing the project completed to very similar to what was asked and putting the knowledge that I have acquired so far makes to want to do more. This is what I should have in mind during any project.
